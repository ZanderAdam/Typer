App for toddler to learn letters and numbers

My little one really likes letters. After spending some time searching, did not come across anything that just works. Decided to create something simple.

Use F11 for full screen mode

As each letter or number is typed it will display on the screen and use speech synthesis to pronounce it.

Tap the screen for a random letter or number
